### What I learned

I learned about svg fill property

```html
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20">
</svg>
```

```css
svg{
    fill: White;
}
svg:hover{
    fill: red;
}
```

### Continued development

Continuing with JavaScript, I'll further explore jQuery while beginning to integrate React for enhanced functionality.

Additionally, I plan to incorporate Pug into my HTML workflow for improved efficiency.

These steps align with my commitment to staying current with industry standards and optimizing our development process.
